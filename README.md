# Overview

This project presents a real-world business problem solved using operations research techniques, specifically Linear Programming (LP). The objective is to demonstrate the use of Python-based optimization libraries particularly PuLPto model, solve and analyze a business scenario requiring optimal resource allocation.Optimization plays a pivotal role in decision-making across industries. Whether it's maximizing profit, minimizing cost or optimizing resource utilization, LP techniques provide mathematically sound and scalable solutions. This project encapsulates the process of defining a business problem, formulating a linear model, solving it programmatically and interpreting the outcomes to inform strategic decisions.

# Problem Statement

The business seeks to maximize monthly profit by determining the optimal quantity of each product to produce or sell, considering:

Limited resources (e.g., labor, raw materials, storage)

Product-specific profitability

Sales and production capacity

By applying linear programming, we determine the best allocation of resources to maximize overall profit while adhering to all operational constraints.

# Tools and Technologies

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Matplotlib

PuLP

# Notebook Structure

The Jupyter Notebook includes the following sections:

# Data Import and Exploration

Load salesmonthly.csv using Pandas

# Clean and preprocess data

Extract relevant metrics for modeling

Linear Programming Model with PuLP

Define decision variables (e.g., product quantities)

Formulate the objective function (maximize total profit)

Add constraints (e.g., resource limitations, max/min sales limits)

# Model Execution and Solver Output

Run the solver and extract optimal product allocation

Display optimal values of decision variables and total profit

# Results and Business Insights

Analyze which constraints are binding

Evaluate trade-offs and opportunity costs

Provide actionable recommendations to the business

# Applications

The techniques used here are broadly applicable in:

Retail: Inventory management and pricing strategy

Manufacturing: Product mix optimization and capacity planning

Logistics: Resource scheduling and distribution planning

Finance/Operations: Budget allocation and cost minimization
